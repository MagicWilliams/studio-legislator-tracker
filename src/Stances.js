Insurance premiums have increased by an average of over 21%. Last year, the Land of Lincoln co-op became the 16th in the country to collapse, leaving 49,000 Illinoisans without any healthcare coverage at all and taxpayers on for hook for over $160 million. Weâ€™re committed to an open and transparent process as we debate this legislation."
